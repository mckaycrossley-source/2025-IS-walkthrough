        You won't believe how crazy these dinos are

        <p>These creatures were walking around like, “yeah I’m 40 feet tall and shaped like a biological tank,” while
            we’re
            over here struggling to open a bag of chips without ripping it in half.</p>

    <p id="pinkparagraph">A T-Rex had a bite force strong enough to turn a car into wet confetti. Its arms? Useless.
        Its attitude?
        Unmatched. Built like a gym bro who skipped arm day for 65 million years straight but could still
        bench-press
        your entire family.</p>
